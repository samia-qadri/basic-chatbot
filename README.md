Hello! This is me Samia Qadri


Here is my Python mini-project:  
  "Basic Python Chat Bot"

This is a simple Python-based basic chatbot inspired by ELIZA
Eliza was the first conversational chatbot built in the 1960s. It was rule-based, modular, and built purely with basic Python logic (no external AI or machine learning models).

â†’ My chat-bot features:
    > Mood Detection:
       It detects user's mood using TextBlob and then suggest an activity based on detected mood.
    > Tells a joke
    > Tells some facts
    > Ask a riddle
    > Offers small games:
        User can play basic games like Number guessing game and rock, paper and scissor.

â†’  Structure:
    main.py : which contains code , structured in functions form to keep it modular for future updates. 
    json file for stroing jokes,riddles and facts

ðŸ“Œ Notes
> This chatbot does not use AI or machine learning models â€” it's based entirely on conditional logic and sentiment polarity via TextBlob.
